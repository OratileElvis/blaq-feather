            <p>BLAQfeather Tattoos was established in 2017 by the tattoo artist, Payne. Payne, having always had a deep appreciation of art, developed a fascination for art on skin, and this grew into a love of tattoos. That love is what drives BLAQfeather to provide high-quality services to all its clients.</p>
